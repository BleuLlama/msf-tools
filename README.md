msf-tools
=========

Some tools to interact with MSGLISTS.MSF message list files from a Sony ICD-PX820 voice recorder

---

All of the content in this has been the result of some reverse-engineering of MSF files.  Currently
the only tool is msf-dump, which will display information about the MSF file.  It will display the
6 folders, as well as a list of their contents, including date/time that they were recoreded.

It is far from complete.

I eventually hope to include a simple syncing program, providing the functionality available through
Sony's windows app.

Note: I am not affiliated with Sony in any way.
